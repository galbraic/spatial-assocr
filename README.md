## Data

Unfortunately, the Twitter data cannot be shared due to the user agreement of the Twitter Api. The Gowalla data is publically available, however, at https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-gowalla.html

## Execution

See `thesis_experiments/run_socal_gowalla.py` for an entry point in the code. This recreates the portions of [my thesis](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8s22s5kb) that reference the Gowalla dataset.
